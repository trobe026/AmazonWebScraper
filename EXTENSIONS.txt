1. Domains beyond Amazon.com
  By altering config.json the scraper is able to navigate to any website, gather a list of product links, then iterate through those links scraping specified data points from each one.  This does require manually identifying selectors to be used in scraping.

2. Products beyond just simply books.
  The app can navigate to any specified "category" and create a list of all contained product links. In order to pull valid data from each product page, the selectors in "ExtractProductData" must match those on the page for requested data points.
