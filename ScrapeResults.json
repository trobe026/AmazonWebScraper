Acclaimed clinical sychologist Jordan Peterson has influenced the modern understanding of ersonality, and now he has become one of the world's most oular ublic thinkers, with his lectures on toics from the Bible to romantic relationshis to mythology drawing tens of millions of viewers. In an era of unrecedented change and olarizing olitics, his frank and refreshing message about the value of inidual resonsibility and ancient wisdom has resonated around the world. In this book, he rovides twelve rofound and ractical rinciles for how to live a meaningful life, from setting your house in order before criticising others to comaring yourself to who you were yesterday, not someone else today. Hainess is a ointless goal, he shows us. Instead we must search for meaning, not for its own sake, but as a defence against the suffering that is intrinsic to our existence. Drawing on vivid examles from the author's clinical ractice and ersonal life, cutting edge sychology and hilosohy, and lessons from humanity's oldest myths and stories, 12 Rules for Life offers a deely rewarding antidote to the chaos in our lives: eternal truths alied to our modern roblems.",
